## Overview

In Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, the focus was on understanding workflow orchestration, implementing ETL pipelines, and integrating Kestra for managing complex workflows. The week covered conceptual material on orchestration, hands-on projects with PostgreSQL and GCP, and advanced techniques like scheduling and backfilling.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of workflow orchestration and how it differs from automation.
- Learn how Kestra facilitates orchestration through its YAML-based configurations.
- Build ETL pipelines for both PostgreSQL and GCP.
- Schedule workflows and backfill historical data.
- Integrate dbt for data transformations.
